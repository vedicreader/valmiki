# lego

A FastHTML + Oat web app starter. Powers [vedicreader.com](https://vedicreader.com/).

Clone it, connect your blocks, ship it.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karthik777/lego.git
cd lego
uv sync
uv run lego-setup       # scaffold .env.example, .github workflow, and SKILL.md files
uv run python main.py   # http://localhost:5001
```

`lego-setup` is idempotent and safe to re-run. The console scripts shipped with the package:

| script | purpose |
|---|---|
| `uv run lego-setup` | init gheasy config, git-lfs patterns, `.env.example`, deploy workflow, install skills |
| `uv run lego-skill` | (re)install `SKILL.md` into `.claude/skills/lego/` and `.agents/skills/lego/` |
| `uv run lego-push` | push values from `.env` to GitHub Actions secrets/vars (use `--dry-run` to preview) |
| `uv run lego-deploy` | Docker + Hetzner + Cloudflare tunnel deploy (`compose` \| `deploy` \| `nuke` \| `env`) |

## How it works

Each feature is a block: a self-contained module with its own config, routes, and database. You connect blocks to the app in order. Auth reads the full skip list at connect time, so it goes last.

```python
# lego/app.py
b.connect(lego)   # blog
a.connect(lego)   # auth — always last
```

Each block exposes a `connect(app)` function that registers routes, seeds data, and wires up any middleware it needs. Blocks can share a database or borrow config from each other. They can also override routes registered by earlier blocks — first in line wins.

## What's included

**core** handles config, logging, caching, scheduled jobs, backups, and the base UI (navbar, theme switcher, page layouts). Everything else builds on it.

**auth** covers email/password registration with Resend verification, Google OAuth, and GitHub OAuth. One `connect()` call sets up all routes and session middleware. Route paths are overridable via `RouteOverrides`.

**hora** is Vedic planetary hours, computed in the browser from the local sunrise and sunset. It is the block that shows what "self-contained" can stretch to: it brings its own head, its own Tailwind stylesheet and its own document, so none of the app-wide chrome reaches it. It serves `/hora` here and the whole of [sankalpa.sh](https://sankalpa.sh).

**blog** is a full publishing block. Posts are seeded from Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The list page uses a newspaper-style featured/sidebar/grid layout. Post detail pages support single-column or two-column newspaper layout, set per-post via `layout: newspaper` in the frontmatter. Code blocks never split across columns. To force a column break at a specific point in a post, add:

````md
```col
```
````

## Core utilities

### Logging

```python
from lego.core import quick_lgr

info, error, warn = quick_lgr()
info("started")
```

`quick_lgr()` reads the calling file's name and uses it as the log filename. No configuration needed.

### Caching

```python
from lego.core import cache

@cache(ttl=3600)
def expensive(param):
    return compute(param)
```

DiskCache-backed with stampede protection. Keys are scoped to the function by `__qualname__` plus arguments.

### Backups

```python
from lego.core.backups import run_backup, clone

run_backup(src="data/db", max_ages="2,14,60")
clone(src="data/db", bucket="my-app-db")   # Cloudflare R2 or S3 via rclone
```

`run_backup` keeps age-tiered snapshots. `clone` syncs to remote storage. Both are scheduled in `app.py` by default when `NEED_BACKUP=true`.

### Distributed lock

```python
from lego.core import get_lock, release_lock

if get_lock('my-job', ttl=60):
    do_work()
    release_lock('my-job')
```

## Auth setup

Email/password:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
```

Google OAuth:
```
WANT_GOOGLE=true
GOOGLE_CLI=...
GOOGLE_SCRT=...
# callback: {DOMAIN}/a/google/callback
```

GitHub OAuth:
```
WANT_GIT=true
GIT_CLI=...
GIT_SCRT=...
# callback: {DOMAIN}/a/github/callback
```

Google and GitHub users are activated immediately. Email/password users get a verification link via Resend.

To change the default route paths:

```python
from lego.core import RouteOverrides
RouteOverrides.lgn = "/login"
RouteOverrides.home = "/dashboard"
RouteOverrides.skip += ["/public"]
```

## Extensions

The dev toolchain that ships with lego:

- **[kosha](https://github.com/vedicreader/kosha)** — indexes your repo and installed packages into a hybrid search + call graph database. Agents query it before writing code.
- **[dockeasy](https://github.com/vedicreader/dockeasy)** — Dockerfile, Caddyfile, and Compose builder in Python. Framework-aware defaults, cache mounts by default, Cloudflare tunnel support.
- **[vpseasy](https://github.com/vedicreader/vpseasy)** — provisions Hetzner VPS servers, deploys with Docker Compose, handles Caddy and tunnels. Same cloud-init YAML runs in local Multipass VMs and production.
- **[cfeasy](https://github.com/vedicreader/cfeasy)** — idempotent Cloudflare DNS and Zero Trust tunnel management. One call to create a tunnel, wire the DNS, and get the token back.
- **[gheasy](https://github.com/vedicreader/gheasy)** — GitHub Actions workflows in Python. Pre-built jobs for test, lint, and PyPI publish. Secret routing from env schema to `gh secret set`.

`deploy.py` in the repo shows all of them composing together — Dockerfile, Compose stack, tunnel, VPS provision, and env wiring in one script.

## Deployment

lego is an ASGI app. `deploy.py` uses dockeasy + vpseasy + cfeasy for a full Hetzner + Cloudflare tunnel deploy:

```bash
uv run lego-deploy deploy    # provisions VPS, wires tunnel, deploys
uv run lego-deploy compose   # generate docker-compose.yml only
uv run lego-deploy nuke      # delete VPS and tunnel (irreversible)
uv run lego-push             # push .env values to GitHub Actions
```

The app runs at [lego.sankalpa.sh](https://lego.sankalpa.sh).

### Two hostnames, one deployment

[sankalpa.sh](https://sankalpa.sh) is the same deployment. Not a second server, a second container, a second tunnel or even a second Cloudflare zone — the hora block already answers at `/hora`, so all the apex needs is for Caddy to know about it:

```
http://lego.sankalpa.sh {
	reverse_proxy app:5001
}
http://sankalpa.sh {
	rewrite / /hora
	reverse_proxy app:5001
}
```

`cloudflared` runs with `--url http://caddy`, so every hostname routed through the tunnel arrives at that same Caddy, and Caddy tells the two apart by the Host header it was going to read anyway. `deploy2prod` adds the apex as a proxied CNAME to the tunnel it just set up — proxied because an apex cannot hold a CNAME in plain DNS and Cloudflare serves one by flattening it. Any A record or parked CNAME already on the apex is replaced. If that step fails it warns with the record to add by hand, and the lego deploy carries on regardless.

Only the bare `/` is rewritten, so `/static` and every other path still resolve normally on both hostnames. To move hora elsewhere, set `HORA_DOMAIN` — it feeds both the Caddyfile and the block's canonical and `og:` URLs.

For remote storage, point `get_pth` in `core/cfg.py` at an S3 bucket via fsspec.

## Style

No ruff, no PEP 8. The code uses fastai idioms: `store_attr`, `patch`, `AttrDict`, `L`. Short functions, no docstrings unless the function name isn't enough. It reads fine on a phone.
