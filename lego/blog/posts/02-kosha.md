title: kosha: what a coding agent should know before it types
summary: A dev-time knowledge base that indexes your repo and installed packages into a hybrid search database and builds a call graph. Agents query it to understand patterns before writing code.

The problem with coding agents is not that they write bad code. It is that they write code without knowing what already exists.

Ask an agent to add a new route and it will write one from scratch, in the pattern it remembers from training data, ignoring the twelve routes already in your codebase that all follow a slightly different convention. Ask it to write an atomic file save and it will roll one from scratch, ignoring `fastcore.xtras.atomic_save` sitting in your environment.

kosha (कोश, treasury) is the index that fixes this. The code is at [github.com/vedicreader/kosha](https://github.com/vedicreader/kosha).

## Two databases

kosha maintains two indexes: one for your project files, one for your installed packages. Both are litesearch databases — FTS5 plus vector search in SQLite. Both update incrementally. Re-indexing a changed file takes milliseconds.

```python
from kosha import Kosha
k = Kosha()
k.status()   # {files: 47, packages: 172, stale_files: 0}
k.sync()     # only re-embeds what changed
```

## Context before code

The main query is `k.context()`. It returns the most relevant code from both your project and your packages, with graph metadata attached.

```python
r = k.context('atomic write temp file', limit=8)
# → surfaces fastcore.xtras.atomic_save before you write your own
```

`env_context` does the same against packages only, faster, with filter syntax:

```python
k.env_context('package:fastcore path:xtras atomic', limit=5)
```

```col                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
``` 

## The call graph

Semantic search finds candidates. The call graph tells you whether touching them is safe.

Every function has a PageRank score. High PageRank means many things depend on it — it's load-bearing. `k.ni()` gives you callers, callees, and one field that has no equivalent elsewhere: `co_dispatched`.

`co_dispatched` lists functions assigned together in the same table, list, or dict. Route handlers registered in the same `connect()` call. Plugin functions appended to the same list. If you need to add a new handler, `co_dispatched` shows you the peer functions and the registration site. You pattern-match and add yours in the right place.

```python
to_date_co = k.ni('fastcore.basics.to_date')
'''
{'node': 'fastcore.basics.to_date',
 'flavor': 'function',
 'file': '~/code/kosha/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/fastcore/basics.py',
 'pagerank': 3e-05,
 'in_degree': 0,
 'out_degree': 2,
 'callers': [],
 'callees': ['fastcore.basics._typeerr', 'fastcore.basics.str2date'],
 'co_dispatched': ['fastcore.basics.to_int', 'fastcore.basics.to_float', 'fastcore.basics.to_bool']}
'''
```

## Where to add

`k.where_to_add('add a new route handler')` combines context and graph to return a `file:line` insertion point, with peers.

## Claude Code skill

kosha ships a Claude Code skill that gets installed into `.claude/skills/kosha/` when you run `k.sync()`. 
Open any project that uses it and the agent loads the skill automatically, runs `k.status()` first, 
and queries before it reads files.

The combination of litesearch for retrieval and pyan3 for AST call graphs is the core. Everything else is scaffolding.
